## Overview

This app is a dictionary tool that allows users to look up definitions of words.

## Key Features

- **Word Definitions:** Quickly find the meanings and definitions of words.
- **Theme Switch:** Choose between a light and dark theme.
  - If using website for the first time, the theme will be applied automatically based on the user's browser/device settings, and this will be saved locally so the app remembers the theme across sessions.
